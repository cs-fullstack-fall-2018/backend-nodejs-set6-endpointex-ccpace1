### Change the frontend
1) Move the task list below everything else.
2) Clean up your code. Move your code to map out the array into a different function. Outside of your render function.
3) If a task has been submitted as done, show it by using a strikethrough or line-through (Use MDN to find out how to use them). 
4) Number each to do item dynamically. (Example. If you have 3 items it should be numbered 1-3. If you delete the middle item it should renumber 1-2.
